Yucheng Zhang is an assistant researcher at Pengcheng Laboratory (PCL), where he
was also a postdoc research fellow.
Prior to joining PCL, he earned his PhD in Physics from New York University
(NYU)
and BS in Applied Physics from University of Science and Technology of China
(USTC).

Yucheng's research interests are at the interface between machine learning,
scientific computing, and physics.
He is mainly working on developing and optimizing physical modeling at
multiscales with differentiable simulation and deep learning.
Reconstructing traditional scientific simulations in the state-of-art machine
learning libraries like [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/) makes these
simulations differentiable and optimizable with neural surrogates.
He is now mainly focusing on the numerical simulation of cardiac
electrophysiology, and he has also been working on cosmological N-body
simulation (see [pmwd](https://github.com/eelregit/pmwd)).
